Welcome to the **Shin lab** at Emory University!  We are a new research group, established in September 2025, in the [Department of Microbiology and Immunology](https://med.emory.edu/departments/microbiology-immunology/index.html).

We investigate how gene regulatory networks define immune cell identity and effector functions.  In particular, we focus on how transcription factors that are expressed across multiple lineages achieve context-specific gene regulation.  To address these questions, we integrate molecular biology, functional genomics, and cellular immunology approaches.

Our research centers on two main areas:
* **Gene regulation in T cell development** – uncovering how transcription factors orchestrate gene networks to establish cell identity programs in early T cell development.
* **Pathogenic CD4 T cell states in chronic inflammation** – identifying the molecular features and regulatory circuits that drive disease-associated, persistant pathogenic functions.

Through our studies, we aim to reveal how transcription factors shape gene expression programs that define immune cell identity and drive their functions in health and disease.
